# SOLID

## Single-responsibility principle

There should never be more than one reason for a class to change,In other words, every class should have only one
responsibility.

## Openâ€“closed principle

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov substitution principle

Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing
it. See also design by contract.

## Interface segregation principle

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

## The dependency inversion principle

Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
